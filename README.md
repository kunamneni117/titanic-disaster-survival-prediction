# titanic-disaster-survival-prediction
Using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

The data has been split into two groups:

1) training set (train.csv)
2) test set (test.csv)


|Variable    |             Definition                |            Key           |
|--------    |---------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|survival    |Survival                               | 0 = No, 1 = Yes          |
|pclass      |Ticket class                           | 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd|
|sex         |Sex                                    |                          |
|Age         |Age in years                           |                          |

|embarked    |Port of Embarkation                    | C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton|


Variable Notes
pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
